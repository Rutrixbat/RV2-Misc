  <RV2R_Settings_SizedEncumberance>Size-based encumbrance scaling</RV2R_Settings_SizedEncumberance>  
  <RV2R_Settings_SizedEncumberance_Tip>Enable to scale encumberance by total weight of all prey. Disable to scale encumberance by count of prey, Can cause problems for smaller preds.</RV2R_Settings_SizedEncumberance_Tip>  
  <RV2R_Settings_EncumberanceModifier>Encumbrance multiplier</RV2R_Settings_EncumberanceModifier>  
  <RV2R_Settings_EncumberanceModifier_Tip>How heavy prey are. Setting too high can easily incapacitate preds. Prey held in extremiedies or absorbed in some way are easier to hold.</RV2R_Settings_EncumberanceModifier_Tip>    
  <RV2R_Settings_EncumberanceVisible>Visible "Weighed down" hediff</RV2R_Settings_EncumberanceVisible>  
  <RV2R_Settings_EncumberanceVisible_Tip>Makes the "weighed down" hediff used for encumbrance visible. This dosn't change it's functonality, it just makes it visible to the player./n/nNote that it will always be shown when hovering over a pawn's moving capacity stat if it is affecting it.</RV2R_Settings_EncumberanceVisible_Tip> 
  <RV2R_Settings_EncumberanceCap>Encumbrance cap</RV2R_Settings_EncumberanceCap>  
  <RV2R_Settings_EncumberanceCap_Tip>How high the "Weighed Down" hediff is allowed to get to. Can be used to quickly get overburdedened preds back up to let some prey out. One prey, assuming no modifiers and same size, is 25%.\n\nAt 25%, moving reduction is -17.5%.\nAt 50%, it's -40%.\nAt 75%, it's -65%.\nAt 100%, it's -150%.</RV2R_Settings_EncumberanceCap_Tip>  

  <RV2R_Settings_EncumberanceTurnOff>Due to how the encumbrance scaling works, disabling size-based encumbrance scaling will not revert to RimVore-2's methods for encumbrance, instead using a method that aproximates it. To revert, set encumbrance multiplier to 0% and remove Patches/Patch_Hediffs_Vore_CapmodRemoval.xml from this submod's Common folder.</RV2R_Settings_EncumberanceTurnOff>  

  <RV2R_Tick_Section>Endo Stuff</RV2R_Tick_Section>

  <RV2R_Settings_EndoSickness>Endo sickness strength</RV2R_Settings_EndoSickness>  
  <RV2R_Settings_EndoSickness_Tip>How quickly (if at all) a pawn should get "endo sick" while safely inside of a pred. At default, it's 1% severity per "vore tick". It's not dangerous, and even puts them in a good mood, at the cost of being loopy and disorientated for about a day or two.\n\nIndirectly nerfs endo storage as a way to keep medics and such safe and makes struggling harder, among other things.</RV2R_Settings_EndoSickness_Tip>  
  <RV2R_Settings_EndoSicknessPacification>Endo pacification</RV2R_Settings_EndoSicknessPacification>  
  <RV2R_Settings_EndoSicknessPacification_Tip>Prey that are too endo sick can no longer struggle, and will be captured if hostile.</RV2R_Settings_EndoSicknessPacification_Tip>
  <RV2R_Settings_AgeRegression>Age regression strength</RV2R_Settings_AgeRegression>
  <RV2R_Settings_AgeRegression_Tip>How quickly, in days spent to days gained, prey regress in age while unbirthed. They'll never regress to below biological adulthood, which varies by race. Set to 0 to disable, and to 1 to prevent but not reverse aging.\n\n(Remember that Rimworld has 60 days in a year.)</RV2R_Settings_AgeRegression_Tip>
  <RV2R_Settings_AgeRegressionCure>Chronic regression</RV2R_Settings_AgeRegressionCure>
  <RV2R_Settings_AgeRegressionCure_Tip>Age-regressed prey have a small chance to be cured of chronic illnesses while unbirthed. Odds increase the younger they get.</RV2R_Settings_AgeRegressionCure_Tip>
  <RV2R_Settings_Pets>Endo pets</RV2R_Settings_Pets>
  <RV2R_Settings_Pets_Tip>Predators and prey who willingly spend this many days straight in a vore stage gain a special relationship, providing a permanate opinion boost. Can be abused, but pets and their preds will get upset if something happens to the other. Pets can only have one pred, but preds can have multiple pets.</RV2R_Settings_Pets_Tip>
  <RV2R_Settings_PetRecruitment>Pets join</RV2R_Settings_PetRecruitment>
  <RV2R_Settings_PetRecruitment_Tip>Prey will join your faction if they become a pet of one of your pawns. Can very easily be abused.</RV2R_Settings_PetRecruitment_Tip>

  <RV2R_Settings_EndoCapture>Endo capture</RV2R_Settings_EndoCapture>  
  <RV2R_Settings_EndoCapture_Tip>Enabled, hostiles are captured and imprisoned if endo-vored by a colonist or colony animal while downed. Works great with heal-voring incapacitated raiders, and enabling means predatory trained animals have a way to help with recruitment.\n\n(Animals trained in predation will heal-vore hostiles if they can't fatal vore them.)</RV2R_Settings_EndoCapture_Tip>
  <RV2R_Settings_EndoCapture_Insectoids>Capture insectoids</RV2R_Settings_EndoCapture_Insectoids>  
  <RV2R_Settings_EndoCapture_Insectoids_Tip>Members of the Sorne Geneline are pacified if endo-captured, ready to be tamed when released. Not at all balanced.</RV2R_Settings_EndoCapture_Insectoids_Tip>
  <RV2R_Settings_EndoCapture_Scaria>Scaria cure</RV2R_Settings_EndoCapture_Scaria>  
  <RV2R_Settings_EndoCapture_Scaria_Tip>Healing vore can cure scaria, allowing endo-capture to be used on rabid animals. They'll only capture or endo-rescue animals you've set to tame.</RV2R_Settings_EndoCapture_Scaria_Tip>
  <RV2R_Settings_EndoCapture_Recruitment>Endo recruitment</RV2R_Settings_EndoCapture_Recruitment>  
  <RV2R_Settings_EndoCapture_Recruitment_Tip>Prisoners set to "Reduce Resistance" or "Recruit" will have their resistance slowly lower while willingly endo-vored. Having a warden chat them up is still faster, and this won't sway the unwavering.</RV2R_Settings_EndoCapture_Recruitment_Tip>

  <RV2R_Settings_AnimalRandomNomChance>Playful predation average hours</RV2R_Settings_AnimalRandomNomChance>

  <RV2R_Settings_AnimalRandomNomChanceModifier>Playful predation modifier</RV2R_Settings_AnimalRandomNomChanceModifier>
  <RV2R_Settings_AnimalRandomNomChanceModifier_Tip>The percentage of average hours to add for each prey a playful predator has. At default, 1 prey increases the average hours from 24 to 30, and two increases it to 36.</RV2R_Settings_AnimalRandomNomChanceModifier_Tip>
  <RV2R_Settings_AnimalRandomNomFatal>Not-so-playful predation</RV2R_Settings_AnimalRandomNomFatal>
  <RV2R_Settings_AnimalRandomNomFatal_Tip>...You, uh, might want to leave this off.</RV2R_Settings_AnimalRandomNomFatal_Tip>
  
  <RV2R_Bonds_Section>Bonds</RV2R_Bonds_Section>
	
  <RV2R_Settings_EndoBondChance>Endo bond chance</RV2R_Settings_EndoBondChance>
  <RV2R_Settings_EndoBondChance_Tip>When an animal and a humanoid are engaged in endo vore, they have a chance to form a bond every vore tick. Wild animals can end up bonded too, so keep that in mind when you take that wolf home with you.\n\nYou really should keep this low.</RV2R_Settings_EndoBondChance_Tip>
  <RV2R_Settings_EndoBondPredOnly>Predator bonding</RV2R_Settings_EndoBondPredOnly>
  <RV2R_Settings_EndoBondPredOnly_Tip>Normaly, endo bonds happen only when the pred is humanoid. Enabling means humanoid pawns can bond while endo prey for an animal.\n\nYou might wanna leave this off.</RV2R_Settings_EndoBondPredOnly_Tip>

  <RV2R_Cheats_StopBleeding>Staunch bleeding</RV2R_Cheats_StopBleeding>
  <RV2R_Cheats_StopBleeding_Tip>Prey have their bleeding gradualy lower while vored. Does not tend injuries, just reduces bleeding.</RV2R_Cheats_StopBleeding_Tip>
